# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms
This program contains the algorithms to calculate the waiting time and total time spent for all of the processes to be completed. This program assumes that CPU is only running one process at a time.

## FCFS: First Come First Serve:
- Working of the algorithm: (Mode: "Non-PreEmptive")
